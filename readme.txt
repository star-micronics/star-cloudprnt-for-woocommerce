Star CloudPRNT for WooCommerce enables Cloud printing technology with your Star Receipt printer.

== Description ==
Star CloudPRNT for WooCommerce will enable you to print automated receipts each time a customer places an order on your WooCommerce based eCommerce website.

This plugin can only be used alongside the WooCommerce WordPress plugin.  For more information on the WooCommerce plugin please visit www.woocommerce.com

== Installation ==
1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Go to your WordPress admin control panel and you should notice a new link for "Star CloudPRNT for WooCommerce" under your WordPress "Settings" category.
3. Once you have opened up the Star CloudPRNT settings page, you will be given a unique Server URL which you need to copy.
4. Next setup your compatible Star printer onto your network and run a self-test on the printer to get its IP address.
5. Type the printer IP address into a web browser to access its web interface and then login (default username "root" and password "public").
6. Navigate to the "Star CloudPRNT" section and enable the CloudPRNT service, then paste the URL you copied earlier into the "Server URL" field.
7. Press "Submit" then navigate to the "Save" section.
8. Choose "Save --> Configuration printing --> Restart device" and the printer will reboot (this can take up to 2 minutes).
9. Once the printer has rebooted, go back to your Star CloudPRNT settings page and refresh it, you will notice your printer will be populated in the printer list which means your printer is now setup and ready to use.
10. Finally, you can now enable the CloudPRNT service within the Star CloudPRNT settings page, once enabled all orders placed through WooCommerce will also be printed out on your Star printer.
